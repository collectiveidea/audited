Description:
	The audited migration generator creates a migration to update the audits table to allow for audit comments. It should only be used if upgrading acts_as_audited from a version which does not permit audit comments

Example:
    ./script/generate audited_migration_upgrade update_audits_table

    This will create a migration in db/migrate/.  Run "rake db:migrate" to update your database.
